## Different Ways to Specify Contrasts
```
options( "contrasts" ) # by defult, it is treatment contrast
options(contrasts = c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly") # changed the default contrast
options(contrasts = c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly")
```

### Setting the contrasts for a single factor
```
contrasts( clin.trial$drug ) <- contr.sum(3)
contrasts( clin.trial$drug)
contrasts( clin.trial$drug ) <- NULL # wipe the attribute and revert the defaults, use a command like this
```

### Setting the contrasts for a single factor (recommended)
```
my.contrasts <- list( drug = contr.helmert, therapy = contr.helmert )
mod <- lm( mood.gain ~ drug*therapy, clin.trial, contrasts = my.contrasts )
mod <- aov( mood.gain ~ drug*therapy, clin.trial, contrasts = my.contrasts )
car:: Anova(mod, type =3)
mod$contrasts  #if you want to check that it has actually worked, you can inspect the value of `mod$contrasts`.
#choice of contrasts does not affect the outcome when you have a balanced design, but, it will have an impact when you have an unbalanced design.
```

## Using the `afex` R package (Analysis of Factorial Experiments) for ANOVA:
`afex` R package is the go-to package for anova analysis, because you don't have to specify the contrast option as discussed above, it yields effect size; it can handle between-subjects design, within-subjects design, and mixed-design.

## ANOVA Analysis. I only list one-way and two-way anova analysis here, for more complex design, refer to the link below for details.

## My favourite R packages for summarize data and visualize data (I hate ggplot, there is always easy ways of visualizing data).
Data and Model Summaries in R with `modelsummary` R package
[Data and Model Summaries in R](https://modelsummary.com/)

`ggpubr`: ggplot2 Based Publication Ready Plots (I use it almost everyday)
[ggpubr](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/index.html#ggpubr-ggplot2-based-publication-ready-plots)

`ggstatsplot`: ggplot2 Based Plots with Statistical Details

`ganttrify` facilitates the creation of nice-looking Gantt charts
