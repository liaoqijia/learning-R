## Different Ways to Specify Contrasts
* options( "contrasts" ) # by defult, it is treatment contrast
* options(contrasts = c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly") # changed the default contrast
* options(contrasts = c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly")

### Setting the contrasts for a single factor
* contrasts( clin.trial$drug ) <- contr.sum(3)
* contrasts( clin.trial$drug)
* contrasts( clin.trial$drug ) <- NULL # wipe the attribute and revert the defaults, use a command like this

### Setting the contrasts for a single factor (recommended)
* my.contrasts <- list( drug = contr.helmert, therapy = contr.helmert )
* mod <- lm( mood.gain ~ drug*therapy, clin.trial, contrasts = my.contrasts )
* mod <- aov( mood.gain ~ drug*therapy, clin.trial, contrasts = my.contrasts )
* car:: Anova(mod, type =3)
* **choice of contrasts does not affect the outcome when you have a balanced design, but, it will have an impact when you have an unbalanced design.**
