## Different Ways to Specify Contrasts
<!-- anchor: different-ways-to-specify-contrasts -->

```
options( "contrasts" ) # by defult, it is treatment contrast
options(contrasts = c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly") # changed the default contrast
options(contrasts = c("contr.treatment", "contr.poly")
```
  
### Setting the contrasts for a single factor
<!-- anchor: setting-the-contrasts-for-a-single-factor -->

```
contrasts( clin.trial$drug ) <- contr.sum(3)
contrasts( clin.trial$drug)
contrasts( clin.trial$drug ) <- NULL # wipe the attribute and revert the defaults, use a command like this
```

### Setting the contrasts for a single factor (recommended)
<!-- anchor: setting-the-contrasts-for-a-single-factor-recommended -->

```
my.contrasts <- list( drug = contr.helmert, therapy = contr.helmert )
mod <- lm( mood.gain ~ drug*therapy, clin.trial, contrasts = my.contrasts )
mod <- aov( mood.gain ~ drug*therapy, clin.trial, contrasts = my.contrasts )
car:: Anova(mod, type =3)
mod$contrasts  #if you want to check that it has actually worked, you can inspect the value of `mod$contrasts`.
#choice of contrasts does not affect the outcome when you have a balanced design, but, it will have an impact when you have an unbalanced design.
```

## ANOVA Analysis. I only list one-way and two-way ANOVA analysis here.

## Using the `afex` R package (Analysis of Factorial Experiments) for ANOVA
<!-- anchor: using-the-afex-r-package-analysis-of-factorial-experiments-for-anova -->
`afex` R package is the go-to package for anova analysis, because you don't have to specify the contrast option as discussed above, it yields effect size; it can handle between-subjects design, within-subjects design, and mixed-design.

## My favorite R packages for summarizing and visualizing data.
<!-- anchor: my-favorite-r-packages-for-summarizing-and-visualizing-data -->
There are alternatives that offer simpler approaches to data visualization.
- Data and Model Summaries in R with `modelsummary` R package. [Data and Model Summaries in R](https://modelsummary.com/)
- `ggpubr`: ggplot2 Based Publication Ready Plots (I use it almost everyday). [ggpubr](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/index.html#ggpubr-ggplot2-based-publication-ready-plots)
- `ggstatsplot`: ggplot2 Based Plots with Statistical Details. [ggstatsplot](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/)
- `ganttrify` facilitates the creation of nice-looking Gantt charts. [ganttrify](https://github.com/giocomai/ganttrify)
- `ggcharts` provides a high-level {ggplot2} interface for creating common charts. [ggcharts](https://thomas-neitmann.github.io/ggcharts/index.html).
- `calendR` uses R to Print Monthly and Yearly Calendars. 
- `ggpmisc` is a set of extensions to R package ‘ggplot2’ (>= 3.0.0) with emphasis on annotations and plotting related to fitted models. [ggpmisc](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggpmisc/)
- `lindia` is an extention to ggplot2 to provide streamlined plotting features of linear model diagnostic plots. [lindia](https://github.com/yeukyul/lindia)

## Mediation Analysis with Hayes' Process in R
<!-- anchor: mediation-analysis-with-hayes-process-in-r -->
The popular method for mediation analysis in marketing (consumer behavior) is Hayes' Process. You can also use `mediation` package in case it is the default method in your field.

- [Download Address](https://haskayne.ucalgary.ca/CCRAM/resource-hub)
- [R syntax for Process](http://www.regorz-statistik.de/en/mediation_process_for_r.html)
- How to install Process in R

```
Download the process syntax and save it to your working directory
setwd()
for example: setwd(dir = "/Users/nphillips/Dropbox/yarrr")

use source function to read the process syntax
source(file = "/Users/nphillips/Dropbox/yarrr/Process.R")

now you can use the Process in your RStudio, just like anyother R package.
process (data = my_data_frame, y = "my_DV", x = "my_IV", m ="my_mediator", model = 4)
```

## A Reproducible Data Analysis Workflow With R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker
<!-- anchor: a-reproducible-data-analysis-workflow-with-r-markdown-git-make-and-docker -->

In this tutorial, we describe a workflow to ensure long-term reproducibility of R-based data analyses. The workflow leverages established tools and practices from software engineering. It combines the benefits of various open-source software tools including R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker, whose interplay ensures seamless integration of version management, dynamic report generation conforming to various journal styles, and full cross-platform and long-term computational reproducibility. The workflow ensures meeting the primary goals that 1) the reporting of statistical results is consistent with the actual statistical results (dynamic report generation), 2) the analysis exactly reproduces at a later point in time even if the computing platform or software is changed (computational reproducibility), and 3) changes at any time (during development and post-publication) are tracked, tagged, and documented while earlier versions of both data and code remain accessible. While the research community increasingly recognizes dynamic document generation and version management as tools to ensure reproducibility, we demonstrate with practical examples that these alone are not sufficient to ensure long-term computational reproducibility. Combining containerization, dependence management, version management, and dynamic document generation, the proposed workflow increases scientific productivity by facilitating later reproducibility and reuse of code and data.
